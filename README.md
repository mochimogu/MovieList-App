# MovieList-App

MovieList App allows the user add a movie to their watch-list. I decided to build this personal project after learning about NodeJS, Express JS, PUGs, and frontend development. Some methods that I used are FetchAPI, REST API for the server, JSON file to store the watch-list, and a movie database website where I get all of the movies. This is just practice on my full-stack development skills. Nothing too wildy and crazy. Just basic fundamentals. I'm still learning to manage all of my files and learning to make things more efficient so this is what I am capable to do right now.

Definitely a good learning and practicing experience. Github Page does not support all of my code so I was only able to display the html and css. Plus I am still learning github and its wonderful tools.
